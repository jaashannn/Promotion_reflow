      question: "How does the referral process work?",
      answer: "When you refer a lead, our system tracks it and notifies the relevant business. If the lead converts to a paying customer, you receive a commission based on your plan tier."
    },
    {
      question: "What industries do you currently support?",
      answer: "We support a wide range of industries including Web Development, Healthcare, Real Estate, Logistics, Insurance, Design, Finance, and Travel. We're constantly expanding to new sectors."
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I earn from referrals?",
      answer: "Earnings vary depending on your plan and the type of lead referred. Freelancers typically earn 10-15% of the initial contract value when a lead converts to a customer."
    },
    {
      question: "How do businesses verify lead quality?",
      answer: "All leads go through a qualification process where we verify contact information and interest level. Businesses can also see ratings and conversion history for referrers."
    },
    {
      question: "When and how do I get paid for successful referrals?",
      answer: "Payments are processed monthly for all successful conversions. You can receive funds via direct deposit, PayPal, or Stripe, depending on your preference."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan later?",
      answer: "Yes, you can change your plan at any time. When upgrading, you'll be charged the prorated difference. When downgrading, the new rate takes effect at your next billing cycle."
